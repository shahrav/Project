To run the script, simply download it and save it at a convenient location on your computer.
I have used knowledge of socket programming and the concept of multi-threading.Both the server and client script can then be run from the Command prompt (in Windows) or from bash Terminal (Linux users) by simply typing "python chat_server1.py" or "client2.py". and also give localhost name.for example-python chat_server1.py localhost 9999 and same for client program.
there can be need of installing thread package in case if you have not installed.
This server can also be set up on a local area network by choosing any on computer to be a server node, and using that computerâ€™s private IP address as the server IP address.

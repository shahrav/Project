                                                           CHAT ROOM SERVER
I have made a simple chat room server and allow multiple clients to connect to it using a client-side script. The code uses the concept of sockets and threading.

To run the script,simply download it at a convenient location on your computer.

Both the server and client script can then be run from the Command prompt (in Windows) or from bash Terminal (Linux users) by simply typing "python chat_server1.py" or "client2.py". and also give localhost name.for example-python chat_server1.py localhost 9999 and same for client program.

there can be need of installing thread package in case if you have not installed.

This server can also be set up on a local area network by choosing any on computer to be a server node, and using that computerâ€™s private IP address as the server IP address.

I have used python and socket programming.
